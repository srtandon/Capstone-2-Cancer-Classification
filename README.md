# Capstone-2-Cancer-Classification
## Cancer type Predictor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*As sequencing technology gets better each year there is a growing trend in diagnostics to use machince learning to quickly diagnose a patient based on the expression of their genes. Most of the research is being done by sequencing cancer cells as well as patient genomes. This generates large datasets with columns numbering in the tens of thousands, one for each gene being tested. We know from research that different cancer strains respond to treatments differently, some responding well to chemo while others do not. With machine learning we could identify if an individual has cancer or which strain of a single type of cancer we can get a head start in treatment or recommend better treatments based on the results. From this type of prediction we can also find which genes to monitor in the future to look at disease progression.
In this project I will demonstrate the how processed expression data can be used to classify cancer and with an accuracy of 88% using publicaly available data from the Gene Expression Ombnibus (GEO) published by the National Institute of Health.*
